Otherwise, if you want to run it locally you must follow these steps:

## Running Locally

First you should fork the Repo and then you need to clone it. You can clone the repo with this command in you terminal.

```bash
  git clone <repo url>
  cd <repo directory>
```
    
After Cloning, go to the client directory and install the dependencies & then start the react project

```bash
  cd client
  npm install
  npm start
```

The React Client will start with the production API link, you can change that by going to constants > url.js > and then change the url to localhost:4343
And this will use the local NodeJS Server.

Also, you need to start the NodeJs Server.

```bash
  cd server
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
So, there you have it.
